### A Landing Page for a video editing company made in Next.JS

This is still a work in progress and quite buggy <br>
For now this is just frontend, no backend <br>
Lots of core functionality is still being worked in <br>

> For some reason the website works perfectly when you `npm run dev` but seems to bug out on the export
